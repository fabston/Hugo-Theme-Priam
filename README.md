## Get the theme

Run from the root of your Hugo site:

```
git clone https://github.com/fabston/Hugo-Theme-Priam.git themes/priam
```

Alternatively, you can include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules). This makes it easier to update this theme if you have your Hugo site in git as well:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/fabston/Hugo-Theme-Priam.git themes/priam
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Preview the theme

Priam comes with an fully configured example site. For a quick preview:

```
cd themes/priam/exampleSite/
hugo serve  --themesDir ../..
```

Then visit `http://localhost:1313/` in your browser to view the example site.
