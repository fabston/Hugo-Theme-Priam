**Priam** is a Hugo theme written by [Fabston](https://github.com/fabston). The theme was inspired by [XMin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin). XMin is based on simplicity while this theme is also focusing on styling and other useful functionalities.

All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [Posts](/post/), [Tags](/tags), [Categories](/categories). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.

### Get the theme

Run from the root of your Hugo site:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fabston/Hugo-Theme-Priam.git themes/priam
```

Alternatively, you can include this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules). This makes it easier to update this theme if you have your Hugo site in git as well:

```shell
git submodule add https://github.com/fabston/Hugo-Theme-Priam.git themes/priam
```

### Preview the theme

Priam comes with an fully configured example site. For a quick preview:

```shell
cd themes/priam/exampleSite/
```

```shell
hugo serve  --themesDir ../..
```

Then visit `http://localhost:1313/` in your browser to view the example site.
